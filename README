Django version used: 5.0.3
Python version used: 3.12.2

Pull the Git repository content into your local directory.
Go to the "prj" folder.

For the local mini test, we would use Sq-lite that comes with the Django distribution.
We will also use Django's standard Web server - WSGI.

Create an run DB migrations:
python manage.py migrate

To run the tests, go to "prj" folder and run:
python manage.py test team_members
[I put only a couple of tests...]

To run the server, go to "prj" folder and run:
python manage.py runserver

[You can activate the Django environment prior to running the server.
This project does not use any non -built-in Python or Django packages.]

The default settings will run the server on IP 127.0.0.1, port 8000.
The DEBUG mode is ON.

Open the browser and access: http://127.0.0.1:8000/team_members/.
This should show you the List Page. From there, follow the navigation steps in the spec.
I added pagination to the list that was not in the spec. The default page size is 3.
